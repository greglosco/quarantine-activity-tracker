## Usage

The Quarantine Activity Tracker lets a user log and organize different activities and objectives they've completed while quarantining. This includes categories of fitness activities, recipes, hobbies, and livestreams. The Homepage features all four categories and displays the user entries, while each category has a link in the navigation bar that will bring them to a category-specific page with activities displayed as well as an input for new activities. Each category can be filtered alphabetically by name with the 'Sort Alphabetically by Name' button. Frontend built with React components, state managed by Redux, and data persistence handled via Rails JSON API on backend.
